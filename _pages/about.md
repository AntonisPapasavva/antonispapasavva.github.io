I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Dawes Centre For Future Crime](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/future-crime/dawes-centre-future-crime-ucl) at University College London ([UCL](ucl.ac.uk)), collaborating with [Prof. Shane Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-johnson-34822310/?originalSubdomain=uk), [Dr. Nilufer Tuptuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilufer-tuptuk-97601858/), and [Dr. Enrico Mariconti](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/E.Mariconti/).  
  
I completed my PhD research at UCL in September 2023 in the field of Discourse Analysis and Data Science, under the guidance of [Prof. Emiliano De Cristofaro](http://emilianodc.com/) and [Dr. Enrico Mariconti](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/E.Mariconti/). Prior to joining UCL in 2019, I served as a Research Fellow at Cyprus University of Technology ([CUT](cut.ac.cy)).

Research
------
<div style="text-align: justify">
As part of my Postdoctoral position at UCL, my research focuses on the identification and detection of emerging online fraudulent activity, and the development of AI-based solutions for early detection and mitigation of such malevolent activity.  
  
During my time as a PhD researcher, my academic research focused on the characterization and detection of extremist, conspiratory-focused, fringe communities in alternative and mainstream social networks. This work employed various quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods, statistical analysis, and Natural Language Processing and Discourse Analysis tools.  
  
Before that, as a Research Fellow at CUT, my research focused on device-centric authentication, federated identity management, cybersafety, and the detection and characterization of inappropriate content online, while actively contributing to EU-funded projects (<a href="https://www.recred.eu/">ReCRED</a> and <a href="https://encase.socialcomputing.eu/">ENCASE</a>).
In addition, I had the opportunity to spend 8 months (in total) as an intern at Telefonica I+D, Barcelona, Spain.  

During my bachelor studies I conducted research on unmanned surface vessels, robotics, and automation (PID controlled systems).

Personal
------
<div style="text-align: justify">
I was born in Limassol, Cyprus where I spent my childhood.
In 2019 I moved to London to undertake a PhD in Cybersecurity.
During my studies in Cyprus I had the luck of visiting several locations in Europe (for business mostly).
However, I love travelling and getting to know about cultures, people, and places.  
During my time-off I enjoy a good sci-fi movie, sailing in World of Warships, and jogging with psychos in Borderlands.
In addition, I am a foodie and I like to cook quite often: Cypriot and mediterranean cuisine of course.
