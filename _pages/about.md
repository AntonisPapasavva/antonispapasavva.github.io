Research
------
<div style="text-align: justify">
During my bachelor studies I conducted research and focused on unmanned surface vessels, robotics, and automation (PID controlled systems).  
Then, while I was undertaking my master's degree in Data Science and Engineering, my research focused on device-centric authentication, federated identity management, cybersafety, and the detection and characterization of inappropriate content. 
I have demonstrated experience with working on EU-funded projects. 
Specifically, I took over highly responsible roles and actively contributed to <a href="https://www.recred.eu/">ReCRED</a> and <a href="https://encase.socialcomputing.eu/">ENCASE</a> projects as a pilot manager and technical lead, respectively. 
In addition, I had the opportunity to spend 8 months (in total) as an intern at Telefonica I+D, Barcelona, Spain.  
Currently, my research focuses on the characterization and detection of racism, misogyny, and other types of discriminating behavior in mainstream and non-mainstream online social networks, large scale data processing, and deep learning networks.

Personal
------
<div style="text-align: justify">
I was born in Limassol, Cyprus where I spent my childhood.
In 2019 I moved to London, UK permanently for my PhD studies.
During my studies in Cyprus I had the luck of visiting several locations in Europe (for business mostly), however, 
I love travelling and getting to know about new cultures, people, and places.  
In my free time I enjoy a good sci-fi movie, sailing in World of Warships, and jogging with psychos in Borderlands.
In addition, I am a foodie and I like to cook quite often: Cypriot and mediterranean cuisine of course.
