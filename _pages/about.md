I am a PhD researcher at University College London under the supervision of Prof. [Emiliano De Cristofaro](http://emilianodc.com/) and Dr. [Enrico Mariconti](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/E.Mariconti/).

Research
------
<div style="text-align: justify">
My research focuses on the characterization and detection of racism, misogyny, and other types of discriminating behavior in mainstream and non-mainstream online social networks, and large scale data processing.
While I was undertaking my master's degree in Data Science and Engineering, at the Cyprus University of Technology (CUT), my research focused on device-centric authentication, federated identity management, cybersafety, and the detection and characterization of inappropriate content online. 
At the same time, I was working as a research fellow at CUT and actively contributed to EU-funded projects like <a href="https://www.recred.eu/">ReCRED</a> and <a href="https://encase.socialcomputing.eu/">ENCASE</a> projects.
In addition, I had the opportunity to spend 8 months (in total) as an intern at Telefonica I+D, Barcelona, Spain.  
During my bachelor studies I conducted research on unmanned surface vessels, robotics, and automation (PID controlled systems).

Personal
------
<div style="text-align: justify">
I was born in Limassol, Cyprus where I spent my childhood.
In 2019 I moved to London to undertake a PhD in Cybersecurity.
During my studies in Cyprus I had the luck of visiting several locations in Europe (for business mostly).
However, I love travelling and getting to know about cultures, people, and places.  
On my time-off I enjoy a good sci-fi movie, sailing in World of Warships, and jogging with psychos in Borderlands.
In addition, I am a foodie and I like to cook quite often: Cypriot and mediterranean cuisine of course.
